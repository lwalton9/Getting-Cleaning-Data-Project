# Getting-Cleaning-Data-Project
Cleaning Data Course Project: Week#4 Coursera Class

README FILE
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

PROJECT SUMMARY
You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
1.)Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.)Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.)Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.)Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5.)From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

SCRIPT DETAILS
1.)READ IN DATA FROM PERSONAL DIRECTORY WHERE FILE WAS STORED
2.)READ ACTIVITY DATASET 
3.)READ FEATURES DATASET 
4.)READ TRAIN DATASET
5.)READ TRAIN SUBJECT DATASET
6.)ASSIGN COLUMN NAMES TO TRAIN
7.)READ TEST DATASET
8.)READ TEST SUBJECT DATASET
9.)ASSIGN COLUMN NAMES TO TRAIN
10.)ASSIGN COLUMN NAMES To ACTIVITY
11.)MERGE THE TRAINING AND THE TEST SETS TO CREATE ONE DATA SET
12.)CREATE COLUMN NAMES OF FINAL SET
13.)GET MEAN AND STANDARD DEVIATIONS ONLY
14.)CLEAN UP
15.)CREATE SECOND TIDY DATASET WITH AVERAGE OF EACH VARIABLE FOR EACH ACTIVITY AND SUBJECT
